# Statistical-Analysis-in-R-
Public Health &amp; Retail Insights

## Overview:
This project combined two real-world statistical studies using UK public health data and retail customer data. The aim was to use statistical analysis and visualisation to understand what drives:
- Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) across UK regions
- Customer satisfaction across retail stores
All analysis was conducted in R and presented in a professional, reproducible technical report.

## Study 1: Cardiovascular Disease in England

#### Objective
* To identify which lifestyle and social factors are most strongly linked to CVD prevalence across UK local authorities.

#### Approach
* Analysed relationships between:
  - Smoking rates
  - Obesity
  - Poverty
  - Wellbeing scores
* Applied correlation analysis and multiple regression
* Produced a clean public-health visual showing the effect of poverty on CVD

#### Key Insight
Areas with:
* Higher poverty
* Higher smoking rates
showed significantly higher CVD prevalence, even after accounting for other factors.

#### Public Value
These findings highlight how social and lifestyle conditions directly affect regional health outcomes, supporting targeted public health policies.

## Study 2: Retail Customer Satisfaction

#### Objective
To understand how delivery time, staff satisfaction, store type, and product strategy influence customer satisfaction in a furniture retail chain.

#### Approach
* Used statistical models and group comparisons
* Tested whether delivery delays affect stores differently across socio-economic regions
* Visualised how satisfaction changes with delivery time across low, medium, and high SES stores

#### Key Insight
* Longer delivery times significantly reduce customer satisfaction
* The negative impact is strongest in high SES stores
* Staff satisfaction also showed a strong positive relationship with customer ratings

#### Business Value
Retail teams can:
* Prioritise faster delivery in high-value locations
* Invest in staff experience to improve customer satisfaction
* Use local store profiles to tailor service strategies
